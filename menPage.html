                    <p>Men's clothing in the 1950s reflected a blend of traditional styles
                         and emerging casual trends, characterized by sharp tailoring and an emphasis
                          on sophistication. Suits were a staple, often featuring narrow lapels and a 
                          structured silhouette, with materials like wool and tweed dominating. The 
                          decade also saw the rise of the "Ivy League" look, incorporating button-down shirts,
                           khakis, and loafers, which symbolized a more relaxed yet polished aesthetic. Casual 
                           wear included short-sleeved shirts and denim, influenced by icons like James Dean and 
                           Marlon Brando, who popularized the rebellious image of the "bad boy." Accessories such 
                           as fedoras and slim ties completed the look, reflecting a time when men's fashion was
                            both a statement of personal style and societal expectations.</p>
