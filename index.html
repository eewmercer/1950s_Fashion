                <p>The 1950s is a time in which conflict, fashion, movie-stars, 
                    and many other significant impacts on history and culture
                    took place. Each element affects the other, and fashion
                    represents a big portion of how the 50s stamped it's 
                    mark in American history.</p>

                <p>Historical context is important to remember when discussing
                    fashion trends. The effects of recovery from the end of WWII
                    as well as the growth of the workforce for both men and women
                    influenced various types of clothing styles. For example, tailored
                    suits for men and women promptly improved and grew in style.

                <p>Various celebrities also played a large role in influencing fashion
                    at the time. Marilyn Monroe, Grace Kelly, James Dean, Audrey Hepburn,
                    and Cary Grant just to name a few. The impact that a movie-star can 
                    have on an audience's sense of style is incredible.
