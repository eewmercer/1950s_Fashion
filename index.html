                    <p>The 1950s is a time in which conflict, fashion, movie-stars, 
                        and many other significant impacts on history and culture
                        took place. Each element affects the other, and fashion
                        represents a big portion of how the 50s stamped it's 
                        mark in American history.</p>

                    <p>Historical context is important to remember when discussing
                        fashion trends. The effects of recovery from the end of WWII
                        as well as the growth of the workforce for both men and women
                        influenced various types of clothing styles. For example, tailored
                        suits for men and women promptly improved and grew in style.

                    <p>Various celebrities also played a large role in influencing fashion
                        at the time. Marilyn Monroe, Grace Kelly, James Dean, Audrey Hepburn,
                        and Cary Grant just to name a few. The impact that a movie-star can 
                        have on an audience's sense of style is incredible.
